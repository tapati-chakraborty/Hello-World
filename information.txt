                       ***  Programming languages  ***

    Wikipedia claims there are approximately 700 programming languages, while others
say that number is closer to 9000! The truth is, there’ve been countless programming
languages created throughout history. But like spoken languages, there’s a hierarchy
of programming languages based on their prevalence and usage.

    Each programming language contains a unique set of keywords and syntax, which are
used to create a set of instructions. Thousands of programming languages have been
developed till now, but each language has its specific purpose.

    programming languages are mainly classified into 2 types:-------
    a)High-Level language
    b)Low-Level language

Low level languages can further be classified into 2 types, that are:----

a)Machine Level language
b)Assambly language
